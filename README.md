# TwoPlayer

A sample web-enabled two-player game. Waits for a second player, or gives you a link to share with a friend. Or, make up your own link!

To run, download this repository, then:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

...and visit [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser, from two browser windows.

Then, play Tic-Tac-Toe against yourself. Don't forget to win!

To extend this code, modify the p5.js code in client.js. If you need extra assets, put them in a `/public` folder inside this one, and refer to those files using the `/public` prefix.
